# CS50 C to JavaScript Practice

This repository is a personal practice space to convert **C programs from CS50** into **JavaScript**.  
The main goal is to understand the logic of C programs and get familiar with JavaScript syntax and structures.

## Project Structure

- `c_code/` - Folder containing original C programs.
- `js_code/` - Folder containing translated JavaScript programs.
- `README.md` - Project description and documentation.

## Objectives

1. Learn C programming basics from CS50.
2. Convert simple C programs into JavaScript.
3. Compare the differences and similarities between C and JavaScript.
4. Build familiarity with JavaScript syntax and behavior using C logic as reference.

## How to Use

1. Add your C program in the `c_code/` folder.
2. Translate the program into JavaScript and place it in `js_code/`.
3. Test the JavaScript program using Node.js or a browser console.

## Notes

- Focus on simple, beginner-level programs at first.
- Keep C logic intact while translating to JavaScript.
- Experiment with different JS features to see how C concepts map to JavaScript.
